## üß™ Step 3: Test It!

1. **Open your dashboard**
2. **Click "Generate Insights"**
3. **First request may take 20-30 seconds** (model loading - only first time!)
4. **Subsequent requests: 2-5 seconds** ‚ö°

### What You'll See:

```
ü§ñ AI Insight 1
Your Air Conditioner (3-star) is consuming 5.5 kWh daily, which is 
42% of your total usage. With Indore's current pleasant 24¬∞C weather, 
you could save ‚Çπ360/month by using it 2 hours less per day.

ü§ñ AI Insight 2
Your 2-star Geyser and Fridge are less efficient. Upgrading both 
to 5-star models could reduce consumption by 2.5 kWh/day, saving 
approximately ‚Çπ450/month (‚Çπ6/kWh rate).

ü§ñ AI Insight 3
Excellent! Your usage dropped 18% yesterday. The rainy weather 
helped reduce cooling needs. Maintain this pattern by using natural 
ventilation when temperature is below 25¬∞C.

PLUS all your rule-based insights!

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

### **First Request (Cold Start):**
- **Time:** 20-30 seconds
- **Why:** Model needs to load into memory
- **Solution:** Just wait, only happens once

### **Subsequent Requests:**
- **Time:** 2-5 seconds
- **Why:** Model is already loaded
- **Great for:** Regular usage

### **If Model Goes to Sleep:**
- **After:** ~30 minutes of inactivity
- **Solution:** First request takes 20-30s again
- **Totally normal** for free tier

---

## üí∞ Free Tier Limits

### **What You Get FREE:**

- **Rate Limit:** ~1000 requests/day
- **Concurrent:** 10 requests at once
- **Model Loading:** Sometimes slow (acceptable for free!)
- **Cost:** $0 forever

### **For PowerPulse:**
- **Typical usage:** 5-10 requests/user/day
- **Your app:** Can support 100+ users easily
- **Perfect for:** Student projects, demos, small apps

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Model is loading" (503 Error)

**Normal!** This happens on first request or after inactivity.

**What to do:**
- Wait 20-30 seconds
- Try again
- Model will be warm for next requests

**In logs you'll see:**
```
Hugging Face model is loading, this may take 20-30 seconds
```

### "Unauthorized" (401 Error)

**Check:**
1. API key starts with `hf_`
2. No extra spaces in key
3. Token is "Read" role (not "Write")

### "Rate limit exceeded" (429 Error)

**Unlikely but possible:**
- Wait 1 minute
- Free tier resets frequently
- Consider caching insights (generate once/day)

### Model Not Working Well?

**Try a different model:**
```
AI_MODEL = microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct  (faster)
AI_MODEL = google/flan-t5-large             (simpler)
AI_MODEL = HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta     (alternative)
```
